## Overview
This repository contains the Python implementation for dynamic course timetabling optimization. The program identifies the optimal schedule by analyzing travel distances, room capacities, occupancy rates, and other constraints.

## Features
- Supports manual selection of classroom alternatives for courses.
- Computes and normalizes metrics such as distance saved, time saved, floors saved, and occupancy improvement.
- Provides a JSON output detailing the optimal course schedule and its alternatives.

## Usage
Run the program using the command line with the following syntax:
```bash
python course_timetabling.py --course_list [list_of_courses] \
    --origin_lat_lon [latitude longitude] \
    --origin_building_name [building_name] \
    --selection_indices [list_of_indices] \
    --topk [number_of_alternatives]
```
## Example
```bash
python course_timetabling.py --course_list 325 661 463 612 321 \
    --origin_lat_lon 30.61507082693666 -96.34047976538754 \
    --origin_building_name "Nagle Hall" \
    --selection_indices 1 4 6 4 1 \

    "updated_next_course": {

## Key Metrics
Each alternative includes:
- `distance_saved`: Distance saved (in km).
- `time_saved`: Time saved (in minutes).
- `floors_saved`: Number of floors saved.
- `occupancy_improved`: Improvement in room occupancy rate.

### Normalization
- Normalized metrics scale values between 0 and 1.
- `distance_saved_normalized`, `time_saved_normalized`, `floors_saved_normalized`, `occupancy_improved_normalized`.

### Total Score
- The `total_score` is a composite score calculated by summing the normalized metrics:
```bash
total_score = distance_saved_normalized 
              + time_saved_normalized 
              + floors_saved_normalized 
              + occupancy_improved_normalized
```
- This score represents the overall suitability of an alternative, with higher scores indicating better options.
- Alternatives are ranked based on the `total_score`.

### Using `selection_indices`
- The selection_indices argument specifies which alternative to select for each course.
- For example:
- ```bash
  selection_indices = [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]
  ```
  indicates:
    - Use the 2nd alternative (`index = 1`) for the first course.
    - Use the 5th alternative (`index = 4`) for the second course, and so on.
- The program dynamically updates the schedule based on the chosen alternatives from `selection_indices`.
- If an index is out of bounds or no valid option is available, the program skips that course or uses a default fallback.
